This quiz attempts to categorize your political perspective by gauging your favorableness towards propositions of policy and governance. Each proposition will have a specific bias towards one or more of the following categories:

- **PROGRESSIVE**<br/>
  Policies which tend to favor social welfare programs, or policies which favor equitable outcomes are generally considered progressive. This may include policies such as universal health care, universal basic income, and lax immigration laws.
- **CONSERVATIVE**<br/>
  Policies which tend to favor traditional values, or policies which favor economic prosperity are generally considered conservative. This may include policies such as lower taxes, banning abortion, and strong immigration laws.
- **LIBERTARIAN**<br/>
  Policies which tend to favor individual freedom, or simply the lack of policy and governance are generally considered libertarian. Many political perspectives are miscategorized as being progressive or conservative, and are actually libertarian. For example, both progressives and libertarians support lax immigration laws, while both conservatives and libertarians support lower taxes.
